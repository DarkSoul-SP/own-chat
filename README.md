# OwnChat - it is my first pet project for practice with <strong>Spring</strong>.  
Functionally this is a twitter-like system. 

**Client-side** — <b>Bootstrap</b>  and <b>FreeMarker</b> as templating engine. 

**Server-side** — <b>Spring Boot + MVC, Data(JPA), Security, Test</b>.

Was used JPA(<b>Hibernate</b>) for working with DB (<b>MySQL</b>). 

<b>Maven</b> as build automation system.
